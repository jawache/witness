# Tool Test File

This is a test file for demonstrating the Witness MCP tools. It serves as a sandbox for validating that all plugin capabilities work correctly within an Obsidian vault, ensuring read, write, edit, and search operations behave as expected.

## Features to Test

- **Search functionality** - finding text across multiple files in the vault
- **Semantic search** - finding content by meaning, not just exact keyword matches
- **Edit/replace operations** - surgical find-and-replace without rewriting entire files
- **File reading and writing** - creating new files and reading existing content
- **Command execution** - triggering Obsidian commands programmatically

Keywords: banana, apple, orange
